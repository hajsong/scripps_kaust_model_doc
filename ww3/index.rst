WAVEWATCH III® solves the random phase spectral action density balance equation
for wavenumber-direction spectra.  The model includes options for shallow-water
(surf zone) applications, as well as wetting and drying of grid points.
Propagation of a wave spectrum can be solved using regular (rectilinear or
curvilinear) and unstructured (triangular) grids.  See About WW3 for a detailed
description of WAVEWATCH III® .
